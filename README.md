# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Steve has been tasked with helping his parents who are interested in investing in green energy.  They've already decided to invest all their money into a single stock (DAQO New Energy Corporation) without doing much research, and Steve is concerned about diversifying their funds.  Steve has collected the data of DAQO and other green energy stocks, and has asked us to help him analyze all of it.  This project is designed to assist him by automating analyses through coding so he can reuse this code on any of the stocks and minimize chances of errors.
